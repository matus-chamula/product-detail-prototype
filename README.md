### About The Project

This is a configurable Product Detail Page based on NOTINO website template. It served as a protoype in order to demonstrate various PDP designs to Product Owners.

### Getting Started

Make sure to serve the web page on localhost (using Live Server extension or similar) in order to avoid CORS policy errors. You can configure the displayed product in the `./js/product.js` file.
